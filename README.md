# **SH**itty **A**ccess **R**elay **T**unnel

I know how stupid the name sounds, because it is.

Utilizes my old ShAW protocol for communication, featuring TLS and Client-Host "login" persay.
Uses everything that old ShAW uses, except the whole "trojan" part. (If you don't know, don't ask. It's not worth the story.)
